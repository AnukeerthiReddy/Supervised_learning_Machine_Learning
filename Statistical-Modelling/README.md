We built a multiple linear regression model in R, on weather dataset to predict the next day maximum temperature:
* The best performing model would be the one with the least RMSE value
* The data was divided into the training, validation and testing data.
* Achieved the best model with an RMSE value of 
* Statistically the model was evaluated considering the p-values and the coefficients
